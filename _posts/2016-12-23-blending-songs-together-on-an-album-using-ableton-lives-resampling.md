shared_description: Blending songs together on an album using Ableton Live’s ‘Resampling’
---

<p>Recently, I found myself wanting a simple way to blend 2 tracks in Ableton Live together. There’s tons of different ways to pull this off. I came up with one quick way that had pretty good results.</p><p>I opened up the 2nd song, created a new track (naming it “# Resampled”), then armed it for recording:</p><figure data-orig-width="480" data-orig-height="137" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/c809e2a7e64408a6da8f67ac2d67c3a8/tumblr_inline_oind5cKnPH1r4begx_500.gif" alt="image" data-orig-width="480" data-orig-height="137"/></figure><p>Find a section in the 2nd song you want to tie into the previous song (I usually took the first 4 bars), press ‘Record’ and <b><i>blammo!</i> </b>– you have a new audio file (made up of any tracks that were playing) that you can copy from this tune and paste in at the end of the 1st song.</p> <p> Listen to the last part of the track &ldquo;Ballast&rdquo; fade out while the pre-intro and finally intro of &ldquo;Euphoria&rdquo; blends in: </p> <div class="audio_player"><iframe class="tumblr_audio_player tumblr_audio_player_154855239860" src="http://chuckbergeron.tumblr.com/post/154855239860/audio_player_iframe/chuckbergeron/tumblr_oine1uSCQ01r8j3z4?audio_file=https%3A%2F%2Fa.tumblr.com%2Ftumblr_oine1uSCQ01r8j3z4o1.mp3&amp;color=grey&amp;simple=1" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" width="207" height="27"></iframe></div>
