Every great newsletter begins with great content.

We built Goodbits to help publishers collect content automatically from sources around the web (Twitter, Buffer, RSS, Slack, Pocket and more). Once the content has collected, teams can then use Goodbits' real-time builder to collaborate using a simple drag-and-drop email builder.

## Sending Email to Lots of Recipients

Deliverability is #1.

We worked with MailChimp, Campaign Monitor, Mandrill, Sendgrid, and other email hosts and their APIs to ensure delivery rates were high and stayed high.

## Content Collection & Curation

At the heart of Goodbits is the automatic content collection. Goodbits started with a simple Chrome extension allowing you to manually add content to your newsletters, and over time grew to a suite of automated tools to pull the best content to share.

However, the main goal was not to provide content to share automatically, but to allow each publisher to curate which content is the best. This way, you have the best of both worlds. Digitally automated collection, filtered down to the only the best hand-picked gems.

## Email Templates

The team and myself at Brewhouse created a variety of beautiful, professional email templates for curators to customize when designing their publications.

If you haven't tried Goodbits yet, I strongly suggest (giving the trial a go)[https://goodbits.io].
